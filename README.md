## Problem Statement
</div>

<div align="justify">
Manual evaluating wastes a lot of resources and efforts, hundreds of papers are printed to be scanned and faxed only to be discarded. Also, the confidentiality of the evaluation might be compromised in the process. Moreover, the criteria are the same for every department in the university, where some of these criteria will not be adequate measures for some majors. Furthermore, reviewing these hundreds filled evaluation forms by the student training department is infeasible. Similarly, assigning a grade based on the criteria is time consuming for large academic departments.

## Proposed Solution
</div>

<div align="justify">
To provide a system that protects the confidentiality of the evaluation forms. Also, will facilitate the process of evaluating a student, reviewing an evaluation and get a grade based on the student’s performance in the company he is training within. Additionally, the system shall provide the coordinators the ability to choose every specific criterion instead of the old generic criteria to meet their majors’ needs.
